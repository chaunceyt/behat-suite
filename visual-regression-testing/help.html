  <p>The admin interface was built to allow for easy viewing of the PhantomCSS baselines and test results. When tests are run for the first time they will generate a list of baselines. These baselines are the screenshots that subsequent screenshots will compare themselves against and take the file naming of "[file].png". When the same tests are run and baselines already exist each test will compare it's screenshot against the corresponding baseline. Test results take on one of two file namings - "[file].diff.png" for passing test results and "[file].fail.png" for failing test results.</p>
  <p>The interface can be split into two sections: the file listing on the left-hand side and the image viewer on the right-hand side. The file listing allows the user to easily view the screenshots that have been generated and by clicking on a screenshot, view it immediately within the image viewer on the right. Screenshots are categorized by baseline, passed test, and failed-test. Within each category tests are sorted by time, with the newest screenshots at the top. Lastly, environmental filters may be listed at the top of the file listing if screenshots from multiple environments have been generated. By default, screenshots for all environments are shown, but upon clicking a filter the user will only be shown baselines and test results from the specified environment.</p>
